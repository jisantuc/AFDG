# Introduction

An evil wizard has trapped you and your most hated rival -- don\'t feel
too bad about hating their, you\'re also their most hated rival -- on an
unusually square island with an unusual motivation: you have 12 hours to
occupy as much of the island as possible. Your rival has been given the
same instructions. There\'s a catch though. Whichever of you conquers
less territory by the end of the allotted time will stay on the island
and perish. Having explained the rules, the wizard cackled "It is now
time to play\... *the most dangerous game!*" You inform the wizard that
that is already the title of a short story, and that you\'re not sure
about whether it is yet in the public domain. Mindful of copyright and
uninterested in debating the point further, the wizard continues
cackling, and, between fits of maniacal laughter, tells you "It is time,
then, to play *a fairly dangerous game, given the circumstances!*"

## Contained in this box:

12 small cubes in red, blue, green, and purple (wizards)

20 round discs in red, blue, green, and purple (oafs)

7 action cards in red, blue, green, and purple

16 walls

16 gates

12 base markers

25 wooden tiles

NOTE: Instructions will be given for the two player game. Changes in
setup for more players are included at the end of the instructions.

# Setup

## First Game Setup

**Place 16 wooden tiles in some symmetrical pattern**. **Add the bases
in some fair layout.** Some suggestions are included at the end of the
rulebook, but it\'s up to you really. This is the island the wizard
transported you to. Next, **place four discs and two cubes on each base.
The cubes are your wizards. **They have bows and arrows, but they cast
spells that make anvils fall on their enemies. They have horrible aim.**
The discs are your oafs.** **Distribute each
player\'s action cards**. There are seven of them. If you can\'t find
seven, at least one is missing. Do subtraction. Find the card or cards.
A wizard (probably) did it. **You are now ready to play A Fairly Dangerous
Game**.

## Not First Game Setup

Instead of placing the tiles symmetrically, **randomly reveal 16 tiles
in a square. Snake draft the base locations.** This means if player 1
drafts first, player 2 drafts second and third, and player 1 drafts
fourth. **Players cannot draft bases that are orthogonally adjacent to
each other.** Do everything else as in the first game setup. **You are
now ready to play A Fairly Dangerous Game**.

## The First Turn

To make the first move happen, **you must decide on turn order**. This
one\'s up to you. If you think there\'s an implicit first mover
advantage in every game, then probably you should spend a lot of time on
this, but otherwise, most recent birthday, ear pointyness, and
whoever most recently rode a train are all fine. You\'ll determine turn order in the
future as well, but it\'s easier then. **Players alternate turns in each
phase**. There are two phases: **action** and **movement/attack/rotate**.
Turn 1 is the only turn without an action phase. **In the first turn,
skip directly to the movement/attack/rotate phase**.

### Phase I: Action

In the action phase, **each player selects a card from their action deck
and places it face down in front of their**. Once everyone has selected
actions, **actions are revealed and occur in turn order**. **Players may
not play the same action two turns in a row.** This restriction means
you can only play each action up to four times.

#### The Actions

##### Re-enforce Oafs

Place a total of three oafs across any of your bases.

##### Re-enforce Wizards

Place a total of two wizards across any of your bases.

##### Rotate one tile 90 degrees or 180 degrees

This is the same as taking an extra rotation phase but more powerful.

##### Trade two adjacent tiles

Pick up one tile and any units on it. Pick up an adjacent tile and any
units on it. Place the first and any units on it where the second was.
Place the second and any units on it where the first was. Tiles cannot
be rotated while you switch them.

##### Place Wall

Pick up a wall that is not yet on the board and place it along an edge
that does not already have a wall.

##### Remove Wall

If you want to remove a wall that was placed using the *Place Wall*
action, simply remove it from the board. If you want to remove a wall
that is on one of the game tiles, place a gate on it. Gates are
always open, so they're pretty much like the absence of walls.

##### Place Base

Add a base tile marker from your supply to the game board. You can add
your base marker to any tile that does not have your opponent\'s units
on it. You may not place more bases than you have base markers.

### Phase II: Movement/attack/rotate

**In this phase, players give their units move and/or attack orders**. The units carry out those orders simultaneously. After the orders have been
resolved, the player must rotate one tile 90 degrees (it can be a tile with no walls or four walls, if one is available). For oafs, moving into a
space is synonymous with attacking that space. Wizards can move first
and then attack or attack first and then move. Regardless of how a
player moves and attacks, rotating a tile must come after all moving and
attacking has been completed.

**Units may move a maximum of one tile orthogonally in any non-walled
direction**. Moving into an unoccupied tile is easy: you pick up your
stack of units you want (legally!) to move onto it and move them there.
**You do not need to leave any units behind in order to attack a new
territory**, but keep in mind that you\'ll just have to reconquer it
later anyway if you want credit for controlling it.

Moving onto an occupied space is slightly harder because your
opponent\'s units will attempt to defend the space. **Wizards without
oafs count as zero defenders**, regardless of how many of them there
are. **Wizards with oafs count as one defender each.** If you want to
drop anvils on some of the defending units first, that\'s totally your
call. **To conquer your opponent\'s space, you must move more units into
that space than your enemy has defending.**

Your wizards can also attack enemy units without moving into their
space. **If there are no walls between your wizard and the target, a
single wizard can successfully attack an enemy unit.** If there is one
wall between your wizard and their target, your wizard needs a friend to
help aim. Therefore, **with one wall, it takes two attacking wizards to
attack a single defending unit. **With two walls, no amount of teamwork
can help your wizards. Remember, they have terrible aim. **Wizards
cannot attack over two walls.**

Any defeated oaf is respawned after orders resolution on one of its owner\'s bases
(the owner chooses). Any defeated wizards are dead.

If you occupy an opponent\'s base, your opponent removes the base tile
marker from that tile and places it back in their supply.

All movements and attacks must be orthogonal, that is, **tiles 1, 2, 3,
and 4 are inaccessible from the current location**. However, **if the
player moves their wizards from the center tile to one of the middle tiles
on the edge, the wizards can attack**.

\[img\]

After all of this moving and attacking is finished, **the current player
concludes their turn by rotating one tile 90 degrees in either
direction**. They can choose clockwise or counterclockwise, and it does
not matter whether any units are on top of the tile they choose to
rotate. **Following that, the second player begins their phase II turn**,
and so forth.

## Subsequent Turns and Game End

Each subsequent turn begins by **redetermining turn order**. Turn order
is determined first by number of territories occupied, with ties broken
by number of living units. Ties in number of living units are not
broken, and turn order stays how it was before. **The first move of a
turn is awarded to whichever player has fewer territories or fewer
units**, if the latter is considered.

Each turn after the first turn begins with the action phase. Turn order
for actions and for the move/attack/rotate phase are opposite. The
player with the most occupied territories completes their action phase
first and completes their move/attack/rotate phase last. The player with
the least occupied territories completer their action phase last and
completes their move/attack/rotate phase first.

**After 8 turns, the game ends, and whoever occupies the most territory
is declared the winner**. If financially feasible and if players really dislike each other, the loser may actually be sent to an island to
waste away for the rest of their days. **If there is a tie for number
of territories occupied, the player with the most units wins. **If this
fails to break the tie, the game ends in a tie.

## With More Players:

With 3 or 4 players, randomly arrange 25 tiles in a square instead of
16. With 3 players, draft base locations normally. With four players,
each player drafts a single base, and then the player to draft a base
last goes first.
